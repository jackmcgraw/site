description: This program was developed for an in-class assignment. It sets up a client-server architecture that allows multiple computers to create and edit shapes on the same sketch pad. Overall it was a fun first project in java dealing with client-server interactions. As this was an in-class assignment, I cannot post code to GitHubâ€”please contact me if you'd like to take a look at it.
