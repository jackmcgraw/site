title: Tiny Search Engine
client: this
category: C
description: This program was developed for an in-class assignment. The search engine crawls the web up to a certain depth, indexes it, and can be searched by the user. Tiny Search Engine was coded in C, and was a great project for learning to deal with memory leaks. Credit goes to Professor Campbell for outlining and designing the project. As this was an in-class assignment, I cannot post code to GitHubâ€”please contact me if you'd like to take a look at it.
