description: This program was developed for an in-class final project. My partner, Jake Herman, and I developed an Android app that allows Dartmouth students to place an order for food at a dining place on campus. We implemented the ability for students and dining service employees to create accounts using Firebase. All in all it was a small, fun project working with Android. As this was an in-class assignment, I cannot post code to GitHubâ€”please contact me if you'd like to take a look at it.
