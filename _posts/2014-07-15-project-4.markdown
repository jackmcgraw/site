description: I developed Mad Pigs when I was in 8th grade using GameSalad which is a platform that doesn't strictly use code. It took me 6 months from start to finish and made it onto the App Store. In terms of code, this project is relatively unimpressive, but it was my first experience taking on a project that–at the time–was massive. Unfortunately I took it down after only a year of being up. I made a small Weebly website for it back in the day... you can check it out at jackmcgrawapps.com
